How to create CDM.tar.gz corpus to put into the container image
=============================
(base) radha@Radha-MacBook-Air-2021 comatrix % ls
CDM				Spark-delta-jupyter-experiments	cryptoknowledge			weaviate
CDM.tar.gz			comatrix			pyspark-example-project		zingg

tar -cf  CDM.tar.gz CDM  --exclude='.git/*' --exclude='.idea/*'
( The above is still not working well ; It is is still including .idea and .git directories; TODO fix later)

cp CDM.tar.gz ./CDM/samples/1-read-manifest/code-java/

After CDM.tar.gz is available in above directory, the command "ADD CDM.tar.gz /" already present in Dockerfile
will transfer this to docker image when you run  docker build -t comatrix/cdmloader .

Now you can follow belong instructions to run CDMLoade and it will create schema,
load catgories and load attributes, entities and relationships corpus into weaviate


How to run CDMLoader/Ingestor
After running weaviate docker-compose.yml run below
docker run --network weaviate_default -e "SEARCH_SERVICE=weaviate:8080" comatrix/cdmloader:latest
